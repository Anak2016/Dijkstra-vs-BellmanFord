== TODO LIST
===========================
> plot


> run iteration in main_file
    : this way we can feed in same data to both algorithm

> Running trails: do m runs for each inputs value. (Fix this)
    >>create method for repeating algorithm
    >>Both algorithm must use the same dataset

> find largest constant of theoritical runtime and plot it on to the graph

> Do I need to code method to compute RT Averge

> Implement all Algorithm with the same input.     ( Fix this)
    : dijkstra and bellman_ford recompute new dataset in everyrun.
    : dijkstra and bellman_ford does not use the same dataset for the same input size.
    >> Should I save the set of different node_size to textfile, so that I can \
    read the same "random data" and redo the analysis on the same dataset.

> Value select in the report must math in implementation
    : I specified value to be between 5 and 20. current I use 5 different input size.
    : show her result and ask if 5 output is okay.

Q: RT Analysis
    : What does it mean "RT Analysis is fully clear and concise for all solutions."

Q: Tables for computing C and graphs
    : What is "computing c"

Q: Conclusion
    : What do i need to write for the conclusion?
    : What does it mean be to clear and concise?

Q: reference
    : How do I do citation for reference?
    : Show we follow any citation standard? if yes, which one is it?
